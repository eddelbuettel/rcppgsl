Description: 'Rcpp' integration for 'GNU GSL' vectors and matrices
 The 'GNU Scientific Library' (or 'GSL') is a collection of numerical routines for
 scientific computing. It is particularly useful for C and C++ programs as it
 provides a standard C interface to a wide range of mathematical routines. There
 are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite. The 'RcppGSL'
 package provides an easy-to-use interface between 'GSL' data structures and
 R using concepts from 'Rcpp' which is itself a package that eases the
 interfaces between R and C++. This package also serves as a prime example of
 how to build a package that uses 'Rcpp' to connect to another third-party
 library. The 'autoconf' script, 'inline' plugin and example package can all
 be used as a stanza to  write a similar package against another library.
