Description: 'Rcpp' integration for 'GNU GSL' vectors and matrices
 The 'GNU Scientific Library' (or 'GSL') is a collection of numerical routines for
 scientific computing. It is particularly useful for C and C++ programs as it
 provides a standard C interface to a wide range of mathematical routines
 such as special functions, permutations, combinations, fast fourier
 transforms, eigensystems, random numbers, quadrature, random distributions,
 quasi-random sequences, Monte Carlo integration, N-tuples, differential
 equations, simulated annealing, numerical differentiation, interpolation,
 series acceleration, Chebyshev approximations, root-finding, discrete
 Hankel transforms physical constants, basis splines and wavelets.  There
 are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite.
 .
 The 'RcppGSL' package provides an easy-to-use interface between 'GSL' data
 structures and R using concepts from 'Rcpp' which is itself a package that
 eases the interfaces between R and C++.
 .
 This package also serves as a prime example of how to build a package
 that uses 'Rcpp' to connect to another third-party library. The 'autoconf'
 script, 'inline' plugin and example package can all be used as a stanza to
 write a similar package against another library.
